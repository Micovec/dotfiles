# Micovec's dotfiles

This is my personal setup for linux

## Stuff you need to change

There are some configuration files that are tied to my specific computer, such as:

- `./waybar/scripts/lock` contains hard-coded:
    - wayland output: `grim -o <output> ...`
    - folder cache: `folder_cache="<folder cache>"`
